# loan-payoff

App to show which order you should pay loans off in

# Disclaimer

This application is intended as a fun project and makes a lot of assumptions about the type of loans, please do not use this as financial advice.

# TODO
- Error checking/feedback to user when entered information doesn't match up
   - Should also cover the case where the loans would never be paid off
- Add unit tests (gitlab ci should run them)
- Cleanup code (likely has extra clone/to_owned that could be refactored)
